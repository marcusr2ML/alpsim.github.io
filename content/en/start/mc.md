The 2D Ising model is one of the most important models in statistical mechanics. It describes spins on a square lattice that can point either up or down, with ferromagnetic coupling $J > 0$ between nearest neighbors (using `spinmc`'s default classical sign convention, where positive $J$ favors parallel spins). Onsager showed in 1944 that it has an exact solution with a phase transition at $T_c = 2J / \ln(1 + \sqrt{2}) \approx 2.269\, J/k_B$: below $T_c$ the spins order spontaneously, above $T_c$ thermal fluctuations destroy that order.

This tutorial simulates that phase transition using ALPS. It is a good first example because the physics is well understood and the result is easy to check.

## Import packages

`pyalps` provides the simulation framework and analysis tools. `matplotlib` and `pyalps.plot` are used for visualization.

```python
import pyalps
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pyalps.plot
```

## Set up parameters

We simulate square lattices of three sizes — $4\times 4$, $8\times 8$, and $16\times 16$ — over a range of temperatures. Running multiple system sizes lets us see how the transition sharpens as the system grows toward the thermodynamic limit.

The parameters for each run are collected in a list of dictionaries:

```python
parms = []
for l in [4, 8, 16]:
    for t in [5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7]:
        parms.append({
            'LATTICE'        : "square lattice",
            'T'              : t,
            'J'              : 1,
            'THERMALIZATION' : 1000,
            'SWEEPS'         : 400000,
            'UPDATE'         : "cluster",
            'MODEL'          : "Ising",
            'L'              : l,
        })
    for t in [2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.2]:
        parms.append({
            'LATTICE'        : "square lattice",
            'T'              : t,
            'J'              : 1,
            'THERMALIZATION' : 1000,
            'SWEEPS'         : 40000,
            'UPDATE'         : "cluster",
            'MODEL'          : "Ising",
            'L'              : l,
        })
```

A few key parameters to understand:

- **`THERMALIZATION`**: the number of Monte Carlo sweeps discarded at the start of each run to let the system reach equilibrium before measurements begin.
- **`SWEEPS`**: the number of measurement sweeps after thermalization. More sweeps reduce statistical noise. We use more sweeps ($400\,000$) at high temperatures, where the correlation length is short and individual sweeps are cheap, and fewer ($40\,000$) near and below $T_c$ where cluster updates are larger.
- **`UPDATE: "cluster"`**: selects the Wolff cluster algorithm instead of single-spin-flip Metropolis. Near $T_c$, single-spin-flip updates suffer from *critical slowing down* — the simulation becomes very inefficient because the spin correlation length diverges. The cluster algorithm flips whole correlated domains at once and largely avoids this problem.
- **`L`**: the linear system size. A lattice with `L = 8` has $8 \times 8 = 64$ spins.

The temperature grid is coarser far from $T_c$ and finer in the range $1.2$–$2.7$ where the interesting physics happens.

## Run the simulation

`writeInputFiles` converts the parameter list into the XML input format that ALPS expects and writes it to disk. `runApplication` then launches the `spinmc` executable. The `Tmin=5` argument tells ALPS to use at least 5 seconds of CPU time per run.

```python
input_file = pyalps.writeInputFiles('parm7a', parms)
pyalps.runApplication('spinmc', input_file, Tmin=5)
```

## Evaluate and plot

`evaluateSpinMC` post-processes the raw simulation output to compute derived quantities such as the magnetic susceptibility and the Binder cumulant. `loadMeasurements` reads the results back into Python, and `collectXY` organizes them as curves of $|m|$ vs. $T$, one curve per system size.

```python
pyalps.evaluateSpinMC(pyalps.getResultFiles(prefix='parm7a'))

# load the magnetization as a function of temperature
data = pyalps.loadMeasurements(pyalps.getResultFiles(prefix='parm7a'), ['|Magnetization|'])
magnetization_abs = pyalps.collectXY(data, x='T', y='|Magnetization|', foreach=['L'])

# plot
plt.figure()
pyalps.plot.plot(magnetization_abs)
plt.xlabel('Temperature $T$')
plt.ylabel('Magnetization $|m|$')
plt.title('2D Ising model')
plt.show()
```

The magnetization drops from nearly 1 at low temperature to 0 above $T_c \approx 2.269$. For small systems the transition is rounded by finite-size effects; it sharpens and shifts toward the exact $T_c$ as $L$ increases:
